# ZombieAttack

Latest compiled jar with assets/configs are located in the out/artifacts/zombieAttack_jar/ directory.

No guarantee that it will actually work for anyone. I suggest building from the source if possible. 

The lwjgl64.dll dependency is included in the compiled source directory. If you're not using Windows, 
the necessary platform specific dependency will have to be downloaded separately.
